# Atomic Digital Product Fit Advisor

A desktop tool that researches a prospective investor (family office, fund, wealth manager) from public websites and recommends which Atomic Digital product to pitch them with a scored fit, talking points, objection handling, and data gaps to confirm in the meeting.

Built as a self-directed project to sharpen BD research for crypto fund allocators



## What it does

1. Scrape: Pulls data from different websites about the prospect.
2. Analyse: Sends the scraped content to DeepSeek alongside the product data of Atomic Digital, and returns a score across all three offerings:
• Market Neutral Fund (USD)
• Bitcoin Market Neutral Fund (BTC)
• Separately Managed Accounts (SMA)
3. Report: Outputs a structured pre-meeting brief which includes the prospect profile, per-product fit scores with evidence, a primary recommendation, meeting talking points, likely objections, and open data gaps. Exportable as .txt or a formatted .pdf.



## Interface

Simple desktop GUI (gui.py): Enter a prospect name and one or more website URLs, click Run Analysis, review the report, save it.

## Tech stack
• Python, requests + BeautifulSoup for scraping, selenium as a fallback for JS-rendered sites

• DeepSeek API (OpenAI-compatible) for the analysis

• customtkinter for the GUI

• fpdf2 for PDF export



## Setup

pip install -r requirements.txt 

Create a .env file in the project root:
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-key-here
DEEPSEEK_MODEL=deepseek-v4-flash

Run:
python gui.py



## Notes

• Scraping is limited to a prospect's own public website or websites that have commented or spoke about Atomic Digital. No LinkedIn scraping or login-gated data, by design.

• This is a pre-meeting prep aid, not investment advice.
